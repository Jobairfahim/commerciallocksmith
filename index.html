                    <h3>Commercial Storefront Door & Mortise Lock Services</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="service-content">
                    <p class="service-intro">A professional Macon GA locksmith regularly services commercial storefront doors, retail stores, offices, and business properties throughout Macon, Georgia. Most glass storefront doors use a <strong>mortise lock system</strong> installed inside an aluminum frame. These doors are opened and closed hundreds of times a day, which causes wear over time.</p>
                    
                    <p>One of the most common components in these doors is the <strong>mortise cylinder</strong>. The mortise cylinder controls the locking function from the outside keyway and threads into the mortise lock body inside the door.</p>

                    <div class="problem-box">
                        <h4>Mortise Cylinder Problems in Macon Commercial Doors</h4>
                        <p>Over time, storefront mortise cylinders can develop several issues:</p>
                        <ul class="problem-list">
                            <li><span class="problem-icon">⚠️</span> Internal rust from moisture exposure</li>
                            <li><span class="problem-icon">⚠️</span> Worn pins or wafers</li>
                            <li><span class="problem-icon">⚠️</span> Rough key turning</li>
                            <li><span class="problem-icon">⚠️</span> Key getting stuck</li>
                            <li><span class="problem-icon">⚠️</span> Cylinder spinning</li>
                            <li><span class="problem-icon">⚠️</span> Lock not turning at all</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="solution-text">In some cases, applying proper lubrication can temporarily improve performance. However, when the internal components (the "guts") of the cylinder become too worn or rusted, <strong>full internal replacement is required</strong>.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4>Professional Replacement</h4>
                        <p>Replacing mortise cylinder internals is not always simple. Many older storefront doors in Macon GA use hardware that may not match modern replacement parts exactly. When upgrading or replacing a cylinder, a locksmith must properly match thread size, cam configuration, and depth. Sometimes minor adjustments or fresh installation work is necessary to ensure the new cylinder fits and operates correctly.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="sub-service">
                        <h4>Interior Paddle & Push Bar Hardware</h4>
                        <p>Many Macon storefront doors also include interior paddle handles or small push bar systems. These allow quick exit from inside while maintaining secure exterior locking.</p>
                        <p>Over time, paddle hardware may:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Become loose</li>
                            <li>Lose alignment</li>
                            <li>Fail to retract the latch fully</li>
                            <li>Cause difficulty locking or unlocking</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A Macon GA locksmith can service, adjust, or replace paddle and push bar components to ensure smooth operation and proper safety function.</p>

                    <div class="sub-service">
                        <h4>Door Alignment & Strike Adjustment</h4>
                        <p>Another common issue with commercial glass doors is alignment. Because these doors are heavily used, the door, frame, and strike plate can shift over time.</p>
                        <p>When alignment is off:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The latch does not line up with the strike</li>
                            <li>The bolt scrapes the frame</li>
                            <li>The key becomes hard to turn</li>
                            <li>The door does not close securely</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Proper door alignment is essential for long-term hardware life and security. A professional locksmith can adjust the strike, hinges, and mortise components so everything lines up correctly.</p>

                    <p class="service-intro">Commercial buildings in Macon, GA are required to meet fire safety and exit code regulations. One of the most important safety features in retail stores, offices, schools, restaurants, and warehouses is the <strong>push bar</strong>, also known as a panic bar.</p>
                    
                    <p>A professional Macon GA locksmith provides push bar installation, repair, adjustment, and replacement services to ensure your building remains safe, functional, and compliant with local fire code requirements.</p>

                    <div class="sub-service">
                        <h4>Push Bar Installation in Macon, Georgia</h4>
                        <p>Push bars are designed to allow fast emergency exit while keeping the building secure from the outside. Many commercial properties are required by fire code to have properly functioning panic hardware installed on exit doors.</p>
                        <p>We provide:</p>
                        <ul class="check-list">

                        <p>If your building recently failed inspection or needs updated exit hardware, proper installation is critical for compliance and safety.</p>

                    <div class="sub-service">
                        <h4>Electrified Push Bars & Battery Systems</h4>
                        <p>Some commercial panic bars in Macon are connected to alarm systems or battery-powered alert systems. These may trigger a signal when the door is opened during certain hours.</p>
                        <p>We service and maintain:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>If the battery fails, the system may not operate properly or could cause inspection issues. We replace batteries and ensure the panic hardware operates correctly.</p>

                    <div class="sub-service">
                        <h4>Vertical Rod & Multi-Point Panic Bars</h4>
                        <p>Some push bar systems include vertical rods that extend upward and downward into the door frame. These rods secure the door at multiple points (top and bottom) instead of just the latch area.</p>
                        <p>Over time, these systems can:</p>
                        <ul class="problem-list">
                            <li>Lose alignment</li>

                            <li>Drag on the frame</li>
                            <li>Stick when pushing</li>
                            <li>Not fully retract</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Because commercial doors in Macon are often large and heavy, alignment shifts are common. We adjust and realign vertical rod systems to restore smooth operation.</p>
                        <p>If a panic bar system is too old, rusted, or heavily worn, repair may not be reliable. In those cases, full replacement ensures safety and long-term performance.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Strike plate misalignment</li>

                        <p>Push bars are also commonly installed on pool gates and gated community entrances throughout Macon and surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
                        <p>Many HOA communities and apartment complexes require:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Self-closing gate mechanisms</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>We install and service push bars on pool gates, apartment complex gates, HOA community gates, clubhouse access doors, and fitness center gates. Because these gates are exposed to weather, hardware may rust or wear faster. We provide replacement and upgrade options designed for durability and code compliance.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <p>In Macon, ensuring push bars are code-compliant is vital, particularly for fire safety regulations. We install, repair, or replace panic bars that meet these requirements. Some push bars are tied to battery-powered alarms, triggering an alert if a door is used in an emergency. We handle battery replacements and ensure the alarm functions properly. Given how heavy these commercial doors can be, we also adjust the alignment so they close smoothly. Additionally, some push bars operate multi-point locking—securing at the top, bottom, or sides. We service and repair those mechanisms, but when the bar is too worn or outdated, we offer full replacements to ensure safety. No matter the age or complexity, we keep Macon's commercial exits safe, functional, and aligned with the code.</p>
